  <h2>JavaScript</h2>

  <br><strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp" target="_blank" title="JavaScript">JavaScript often abbreviated as <u>JS</u></a></strong>, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>
